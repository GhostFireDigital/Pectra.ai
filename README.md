# Pectra.ai

**AI + UX for Ethereum’s Next Era**  
Design-forward, community-powered tools to enhance user experience during Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade cycle.

🚀 [**Live Demo**](https://pectra-ai.netlify.app) ← _Update this once deployed on Netlify_

---

## 🧪 What We’re Building

**Pectra.ai** is a community-led initiative exploring how **AI** and **user-first design** can redefine Ethereum interactions in 2025.

🛠️ **Current Toolkit**  
- `AI Wallet Walkthrough Generator` – Contract wallet onboarding
- `Onboarding Simulation Engine` – Dev UX testbench
- `UX Audit Toolkit` – AI + heuristics for dApp reviews
- `Community UX Portal` – Submit/vote on design experiments

---

## 💡 Protocol Purpose

We believe Ethereum’s experience layer should be:
- **Human-centered** 🧠
- **Transparent** 🔍
- **AI-Enhanced** 🤖  
Our tools help developers ship more intuitive dApps that anyone can use.
